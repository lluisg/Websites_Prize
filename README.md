# MOVING BUTTONS

Couple of projects where you can try to win a prize if you are able to click the button:
- The first web ([**LINK**](https://moving-button.onrender.com)) moves the button around between 8 random positions seleted each time you reload the page.
- The second web ([**LINK**](https://blocking-button.onrender.com)) changes the available button to click among a group of 8 that changes positions each time you reload the page.
